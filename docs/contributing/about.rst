Contribute to Django CMS
########################

As an open source project, django CMS is only as strong as its community.
Without the donation of time and skill of our contributors and the financial support of our association members (link who is behind dca),
it would not be possible to maintain the django CMS project. The community is the backbone of django CMS.

Contributors to django CMS come from across the world, and have a wide range and
levels of skills and expertise. No matter if you are a developer, usability enthusiast,
designer or copywriter. Young or old. Experienced or inexperienced. Every contribution, however small, is valued.

You don’t need to be an expert developer to make a valuable contribution - all you
need is a little knowledge of the system, and a willingness to follow the contribution guidelines

Open source contribution can include taking part in discussions, filing bug reports,
proposing improvements, contributing code or writing documentation.

Are you new to Django CMS?
***********************************

If you are new to django CMS, then we recommend you to first familiarize yourself
with the CMS and start with the "Getting Started" section (link)

Nevertheless, beginners can also contribute to the project, for example by helping
to improve the documentation, or other tasks, such as writing a blog article series
about your journey of learning django CMS (See community tasks -> link)

After you have acquainted yourself with django CMS and maybe already created your
first website with it, you should start looking at contributing to the django CMS codebase.

Contributor Community
*********************

But before you start getting your hands dirty, you should make sure to join us
online in order to stay updated with the latest news and to connect with other
users across the world. It may also be helpful to get some context on the django
CMS project first. In the chapter "Who is behind django CMS" (Insert link) we give
you a complete tour of the organization behind django CMS, its people and processes.

Here’s an overview of our communication channels:

* django CMS Slack channel (insert link)
* Discourse forum (insert link)
* Discord server (insert link)
* StackOverflow (insert link)

You should make sure to join our Slack workspace. It is our main communication
platform. Users from all over the world use Slack to talk about django CMS and
to support each other in answering support requests.

For people who prefer to use a traditional user board, we have set up a Discourse
forum. It contains question and answer threads about django CMS and is actively
monitored by our team of supporters. It can also be used to request features.

Our Discord server is used for ad hoc online meetings or for after work hangouts.

StackOverflow is a very popular, community-based space to find and contribute
answers to technical challenges

You can also follow us on social media:

* the `@djangocms <https://twitter.com/djangocms>`_ Twitter account for general announcements
* the `django CMS Association LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/company/django-cms-association>`_ account

*****************
Join a work group
*****************

Most participation in the django CMS is organized through work groups.
These are small, independent groups of volunteers who have come together to work on a project.

It is entirely up to you whether you want to join such a work group (Link to work group)
and join other django CMS enthusiasts or if you want to work on topics on your own.
By the way, you can also create your own work group. Find out more here (insert link)

Are you interested in knowledge sharing and improving your skills? Then a workgroup
might be the right choice for you. Would you rather decide for yourself when and what
you work on? Then you can choose a task from our community tasks list or contribute directly
on Github by answering issues or create Pull Requests.

All activity in the community is governed by our :ref:`code_of_conduct`
