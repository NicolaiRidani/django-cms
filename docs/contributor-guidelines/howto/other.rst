As you can imagine, as an open source project we need help on all fronts. Whether it's content creation or user support. Any help is welcome. Would you like to present your django CMS project? Then create a case study together with us. Are you an expert in a field and would like to share your knowledge with others? Then start a workshop series and teach other people. Or do you like writing blog articles and would like to draw the attention of a large readership to a topic related to django CMS? Then publish your article on our website.
