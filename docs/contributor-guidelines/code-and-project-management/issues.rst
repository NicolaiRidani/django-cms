Raising an issue
****************

.. warning::
    If you think you have discovered a security issue in our code, please report it privately, by emailing us at security@djangocms.com.
    Please do not raise it in any public forum until we have had a chance to deal with it.

Except in the case of security matters, of course, you’re welcome to raise issues in any way that suits you - `using Discourse`_,
or the `Slack group`_
or in person if you happen to meet another django CMS developer.

It’s very helpful though if you don’t just raise an issue by mentioning it to
people, but actually file it too, and that means creating a `new issue on GitHub`_.

There’s an art to creating a good issue report.

The Title needs to be both succinct and informative. “show_sub_menu displays incorrect nodes when used with soft_root” is helpful, whereas “Menus are broken” is not.

In the Description of your report, we’d like to see:

* how to reproduce the problem
* what you expected to happen
* what did happen (a traceback is often helpful, if you get one)

***************************
Getting your issue accepted
***************************

Other django CMS developers will see your issue, and will be able to comment. A core developer may add further comments, or a :ref:`label <contributor-guidelines-code-and-project-management-label-reference>`.

The important thing at this stage is to have your issue accepted. This means that we’ve agreed it’s a genuine issue, and represents something we can or are willing to do in the CMS.

You may be asked for more information before it’s accepted, and there may be
some discussion before it is. It could also be rejected as a non-issue
(it’s not actually a problem) or won’t fix (addressing your issue is beyond the
scope of the project, or is incompatible with our other aims).

Feel free to explain why you think a decision to reject your issue is incorrect - very few decisions are final, and we’re always happy to correct our mistakes.
