Introduction

The pages in this section of the documentation are aimed at the newcomer to
django CMS. They're designed to help you get started quickly, and show how
easy it is to work with django CMS as a developer who wants to customise it and
get it working according to their own requirements.

If you want to install django CMS into an existing project, or prefer to configure django CMS by
hand, rather than using the automated installer, see :doc:`/gettingstarted/index` and then follow the
rest of the tutorials.

Either way, you'll be able to find support and help from the numerous friendly members of the
django CMS community, either on our `Discourse forum <https://discourse.django-cms.org>`_ or `our
Slack group <https://www.django-cms.org/slack>`_.
